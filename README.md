## About project

This project is a ("`Logical Costing System`") that we strive to create using the latest advanced technology so you can forget about delays and slow service forever.
<br>
<br>
Nowadays large projects use such tools as react js or vue js, but we went further and decided to try out one of the most productive frameworks known at the moment. Namely ("`Solid Js`") it contributes to the fact that our project works fantastically fast and does not spend a lot of memory unlike similar projects on react js or preact js or vue js.
